This generator serves as a shortcut for making a nice organised list of team members displayed on a html webpage. Just by answering a series of questions this generator does all the work for you! Every company could use a quick and easy way to achieve this without needing to repeat the same code over and over again. I was able to learn more about async functions, inquirer prompt and passing tests with Jest.

## Installation


If the folder contains a package.json with dependencies listed and/or package-lock.json file, simply enter 'npm install' in the terminal.
If none of those files are available or there aren't any dependencies listed in the package.json make sure to follow these steps:

1. type 'npm init' into the terminal
2. type 'npm package-name@version' for each package listed below:


-inquirer@6.3.1

-jest@24.8.0



## Usage

After cloning the repos and installing all the npm packages open index.js in your terminal and run node index.js. First it will ask for the managers information before it lets the user choose between adding an engineer, adding an intern or finish the team and generating the html file..
